## About Me
I am a PhD researcher in Computational Relativistic Astrophysics at Goethe University, Frankfurt. I specialize in developing GPU-enabled simulations and optimizing high-performance computing workflows.

## Projects
### [GRACE Project](https://github.com/username/grace)
A general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics solver for heterogeneous computing, designed to run efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs.

- Achieved 1+ TFLOP/s throughput
- 100+ million cell updates per second
- Ongoing optimizations and improvements

### [SpeKtraLib](https://github.com/username/spektralib)
An efficient library for solving partial differential equations with spectral methods. Leveraging Kokkos for performance portability across multiple architectures.
